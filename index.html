    main features:
    function a)
        have buttons with user input. These buttons are split into 3 sections: workout intensity, body part(s, up to 3)(pass a list into function), and perhaps workout type.

    Function b:
        will take parameters of workout. First parameter, workout intensity will have an if statement that will depending on intensity, generate x number of reptitions. 
        Set that to variable called num reps.
        Next, body part(s). For each body part provided, iterate over and call generate exercise for each, creating a new array for all and these connect to the final array of all the arrays

    Function C: 
        Parameter: the array previously created will now be passed out and split into the small arrays. Then it will be
